This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory using an unvalidated index and an uninitialized base pointer. The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with added bounds checking and base pointer initialization.  The vulnerability arises from the potential for the index register `ecx` to exceed the array bounds and `ebx` to point to an invalid memory location. This can lead to program crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. The solution incorporates robust checks to prevent such issues and ensure safer memory access.
